/**
   Polls an address in memory mapped I/O space until an exit condition is met, or 
   a timeout occurs. 

   This function provides a standard way to poll a PCI memory location. A PCI memory read
   operation is performed at the PCI memory address specified by Address for the width specified
   by Width. The result of this PCI memory read operation is stored in Result. This PCI memory
   read operation is repeated until either a timeout of Delay 100 ns units has expired, or (Result &
   Mask) is equal to Value.

   This function provides a standard way to poll a PCI I/O location. A PCI I/O read operation is
   performed at the PCI I/O address specified by Address for the width specified by Width.
   The result of this PCI I/O read operation is stored in Result. This PCI I/O read operation is
   repeated until either a timeout of Delay 100 ns units has expired, or (Result & Mask) is equal
   to Value.

   @param[in] This      A pointer to the EFI_PCI_ROOT_BRIDGE_IO_PROTOCOL.
   @param[in] Width     Signifies the width of the I/O operations.
   @param[in] Address   The base address of the I/O operations. The caller is responsible
                        for aligning Address if required.
   @param[in] Mask      Mask used for the polling criteria. Bytes above Width in Mask
                        are ignored. The bits in the bytes below Width which are zero in
                        Mask are ignored when polling the I/O address.
   @param[in] Value     The comparison value used for the polling exit criteria.
   @param[in] Delay     The number of 100 ns units to poll. Note that timer available may
                        be of poorer granularity.
   @param[out] Result   Pointer to the last value read from the memory location.
   
   @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The last data returned from the access matched the poll exit criteria.
   @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  Width is invalid.
   @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  Result is NULL.
