  Read BufferSize bytes from Offset into Buffer.
  Reads may support reads that are not aligned on
  sector boundaries. There are three cases:
    UnderRun - The first byte is not on a sector boundary or the read request is
               less than a sector in length.
    Aligned  - A read of N contiguous sectors.
    OverRun  - The last byte is not on a sector boundary.

  @param  This                  Protocol instance pointer.
  @param  MediaId               Id of the media, changes every time the media is
				replaced.
  @param  Offset                The starting byte offset to read from
  @param  BufferSize            Size of Buffer
  @param  Buffer                Buffer containing read data

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The data was read correctly from the device.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The device reported an error while performing
				the read.
  @retval EFI_NO_MEDIA          There is no media in the device.
  @retval EFI_MEDIA_CHNAGED     The MediaId does not matched the current device.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER The read request contains device addresses that
				are not valid for the device.
